Description of the program logic.

There are several types of simulation cells during the process of GB construction
IC - input cell, it should be primitive hexagonal lattice with four index system
GC - cell with one grain
GBC - cell with grain boundary


1. According to three directions uvtw1, uvtw2 and uvtw3 program choose 3 vectors r1, r2, r3 of GC. uvtw1 is usually perpendicular (or close to it) to the grain boundary plane. uvtw2 is usually sliding direction; uvtw3 is usually rotation axis of boundary
If test parameter is equal to 1, it shows additional information including lengths of the vectors, volume of GC, number of atoms and others. 

2. Program rotate GC to combine the vectors with coordinate axes in the following sequence:
a) r3 with z axis
b) normal for hkl with x axis; i.e. hkl plane will be perpendicular to x axis
because sliding direction lies in plane you will have r2 combined with y, if r2 is perpendicular to r3
If you have orthogonal cell, r1 automatically combined with x.

3. Then GC is filling with atoms. Technically program makes translations of IC and includes only atoms which are in GC. Be careful to have enough periodcell values.

4. Construction of boundary. Method make_boundary(); It makes mirror operation along x axis. It uses slicepms values. See description.

5. Method delnear allows to delete atoms which are closer than value of deldist parameter. See description

6. Cell is shifted according to shiftcell parameters.

7. Finally program writes geometry files
List of input parameters:
acell, a_c_conv, rprim, natom, xred, typat, periodcell, hkl1
Description of input parameters:
acell
a_c_conv
Mnemonics: convergence of cell geometry according to a and c lattice parameters
Variable type: db array a_c_conv[4] 
Default is 0 0 0 0
//	[0] version - start number of version
//	[1] nva- value in percents; lattice parameter a will be changed in [-nva, +nva] range
//	[2] nvc - the same for c parameter
//	[3] nsteps - number of values between ranges


rprim
natom
xred
typat
periodcell

hkl1
Mnemonics: Miller indexes of boundary plane
Variable type: int array hkl1[3] 
Default is 0 0 0 
Normally this is the boundary plane. The parameter allows to calculate spacing between hkl1 planes.

uvtw1
uvtw2
uvtw3
mul
name
deldist
Mnemonics: Parameters of slicing
Variable type: dp deldist
Default is 3 (Bohr)
The atoms which are situated closer than deldist will be deleted.


slicepms
Mnemonics: Parameters of slicing
Variable type: dp array slicepms[3] 
Default is 0 0 0 
Parameters depend on spacing, which is the spacing between hkl1 planes. 
The first parameter determines the number of layers with min_spacing length which will be sliced from both parts of GC. Usually it allows to choose different boundaries.
The second parameter controls number of layers sliced only from one side. This allows to choose two identical boundaries in GBC.
The third parameter says program the number of min_spacing lengths in spacing. This allows to determine min_spacing. min_spacing = spacing / slicepms[2]. Should be calculated by user or can be found by checking.


shiftcell
Mnemonics: Shift of simulation cell
Variable type: dp array shiftcell[2] 
Default is 1 0 
The first number determines direction of shift: 0 along r1, 1 along r2 and 2 along r3. The second number determines value of shift in the lengths of corresponding vectors.
